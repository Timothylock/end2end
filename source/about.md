### Who are you?
I currently work as an associate engineer at Wattpad.

I graduated from the Computer Science program at the University of Toronto.

I was a programming / robotics instructor at LogicFusion.

I have been a part of University of Toronto Aerospace Team and recently as a division lead for over 3 years.

I have worked on many quirky projects including a inventory system and a pancake printer.

### Examples or it didn’t happen
I write code and some idiotic comments about things I see.

I hear people telling me to blog it instead. Done.

I made some cool projects as well.

I have a résumé if you’re into that sort of thing.
