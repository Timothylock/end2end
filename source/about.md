### Who are you?
I currently work as an associate engineer at [Wattpad](https://wattpad.com).

I graduated from the Computer Science program at the [University of Toronto](https://www.utoronto.ca/).

I was a programming / robotics instructor at [LogicFusion](http://logicfusion.ca).

I have been a part of [University of Toronto Aerospace Team](https://utat.ca) and recently as a division lead for over 3 years.

### Examples or it didn’t happen
I have also worked on projects such as [creating a sign-in with Apple Golang library](https://github.com/timothylock/go-signin-with-apple)

I am also silly, so how about a [pancake printer](https://devpost.com/software/printcakes-pancake-printer)?

I hear people telling me this is too long and to blog it. [Done](https://timothylock.ca/blog/).

### I still need a résumé
